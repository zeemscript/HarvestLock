/**
 * These three apps each keep their own copy of api.ts rather than
 * sharing one package — a deliberate convention, not an oversight — so
 * the standing risk is the copies drifting apart silently as each app
 * evolves. `get`/`post`'s thrown message is the likeliest place for that
 * to happen unnoticed, and also the costliest: it is load-bearing, not
 * cosmetic. coop-pwa's `getAllocationLedger` decides whether "no
 * allocation recorded yet" is a normal empty state or a genuine failure
 * by pattern-matching `err.message`, and every app's UI puts this string
 * in front of a user verbatim. Change the shape in one copy and that
 * check quietly reclassifies an expected state as an error.
 *
 * This file is itself duplicated verbatim across the three apps, which
 * is the point: if one copy's formatting is edited, that app's suite
 * fails on its own rather than the three silently disagreeing.
