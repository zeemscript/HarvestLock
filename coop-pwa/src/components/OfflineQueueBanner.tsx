/**
 * Surfaces claims that got queued because the device had no network at
 * all when "Claim" was tapped — see offlineQueue.ts for why this stores
 * intent (contract + tranche), not a pre-signed transaction. Deliberately
 * no automatic retry on a `window.addEventListener("online", ...)`
 * listener: `navigator.onLine`/the `online` event are both known-
 * unreliable signals (a device can report "online" while still unable to
 * reach this specific API), and retrying still needs the cooperative's
 * own wallet to sign via Freighter, which needs the user present anyway
 * — a visible "Retry" button they tap when they believe they're back is
 * simpler and just as correct as trying to auto-detect reconnection.
