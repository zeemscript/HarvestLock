# `reassign_buyer` propose / sign / finalize — sequence diagram

How a buyer-position reassignment (PRD §4.8, contract `reassign_buyer()`) is
completed when the three required signers are on separate devices and no
script or process ever holds more than one private key. This is the same
staged multi-party mechanism `cancel` (two parties) and `resolve_dispute`
(three parties) use — see `../README.md`'s "Staged multi-party signing"
section for the shared design, and `../HANDOFF.md` for what's live-verified.

**Checked against the code, not from memory:** `src/server.ts` (routes),
`src/stellar/multiParty.ts` (propose/finalize), `src/db/pendingMultisigProposals.ts`
(Postgres staging), `src/db/migrations/004_generalize_multisig_proposals.sql`,
`src/stellar/tx.ts` (submit), and `HarvestLock-Contracts`'
`contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs` (`reassign_buyer`, `require_once_each`) as of
18 Oct 2026. If any of those change, update this file in the same change.

## Step-by-step, with where each piece lives

| # | Step | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Current buyer proposes with `{ proposerPublicKey, newBuyer }`. | `src/server.ts` `POST /commitments/:contractId/tx/reassign-buyer/propose` |
| 2 | Existing active `reassign_buyer` proposal is returned as-is (200); a new one is inserted (201). `cancel` and `resolve_dispute` proposals are separate rows and don't block it. | `findActiveProposal` (`src/db/pendingMultisigProposals.ts:71`), `createProposal` (`:34`) |
| 3 | Proposal is limited to the *current* buyer (403 otherwise) — unlike cancel/dispute, which more than one party may start. | `src/server.ts:749-756` |
| 4 | Simulation is sourced from the proposer, so the proposer's own auth entry is `source_account` and is never handed to a wallet. | `buildMultiPartyProposal` (`src/stellar/multiParty.ts:89`) |
| 5 | `signatureExpirationLedger` is set **server-side** on every non-source entry (~17,280 ledgers ≈ 24 h). Freighter's `signAuthEntry(entryXdr)` takes no expiration argument, so this can't be done at signing time. | `src/stellar/multiParty.ts:87,114-117` |
| 6 | The proposal row stores the function XDR, the original simulation's `sorobanData` (resource footprint), and the entries; TTL is 24 h, kept roughly in sync with the ledger-sequence expiry. | `MULTISIG_PROPOSAL_TTL_MS` (`src/server.ts:203`), migration `004_generalize_multisig_proposals.sql` |
| 7 | Any viewer polls `GET .../reassign-buyer/propose`, which returns `{ proposal: … \| null }`; `pending_entries` contains only entries still unsigned. | `src/server.ts:778`, `serializeProposal` (`:206`) |
| 8 | Each other party signs their own `entry_xdr` with their wallet's `signAuthEntry` and posts it back. The route is method-agnostic — a proposal ID is already globally unique. | `POST .../tx/propose/:proposalId/sign` (`src/server.ts:843`) |
| 9 | Signing is a locked read-modify-write (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`), so two parties signing at once can't clobber each other; a wrong signer or a repeat signature is rejected (400). | `signProposalEntry` (`src/db/pendingMultisigProposals.ts:102`) |
| 10 | When every non-source entry is signed, the API rebuilds the transaction from stored pieces (deliberately **not** re-simulating) and flips the proposal to `ready`. | `finalizeMultiPartyProposal` (`src/stellar/multiParty.ts:140`), `markReady` (`:139`) |
| 11 | The proposer signs `ready_xdr` classically and submits through the existing endpoint with `completeProposalId`; on success the proposal is marked `completed`. | `POST /transactions/submit` (`src/server.ts:895`), `markCompleted` (`src/db/pendingMultisigProposals.ts:143`) |
| 12 | On-chain, all three parties' auth is verified and `buyer` is rewritten; no funds move. | `reassign_buyer` + `require_once_each` (`HarvestLock-Contracts/contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`) |

## Edge cases and checks (all enforced in code, not just documented)

- **Who may propose:** only the commitment's current buyer — 403 for the
  cooperative or the incoming buyer, checked against a live chain read.
- **Idempotent propose:** proposing again while a `reassign_buyer` proposal
  is active for that contract returns the existing one; a `cancel` proposal
  on the same contract is independent and doesn't collide.
- **Wrong signer / double sign:** 400 — the signer must have an unsigned
  entry on *this* proposal, so signing twice or signing someone else's
  entry fails without corrupting the staged row.
- **Expiry:** proposals expire after 24 h (`expires_at`); signing an
  expired proposal is rejected with "propose a fresh one". The auth entries
  themselves also carry a ~24 h on-chain `signatureExpirationLedger`, so a
  stale staged row can't produce a submittable transaction.
- **Reachable states:** `Draft`, `Locked`, `Advance1Released`,
  `CheckpointPassed`, `Advance2Released`, `ReadyForDelivery`. Simulating
  from any other status fails with the contract's `InvalidState`, because
  past `Delivered` the buyer field gates no remaining action.
- **Distinct/overlapping parties:** the contract's `require_once_each`
  calls `require_auth()` once per distinct address, so if `newBuyer` were
  the cooperative, only the cooperative's single entry would need signing
  — the API doesn't special-case this; it stages however many auth
  entries the simulation returns. (The deployed Deployment 10 WASM
  predates this dedupe — contract main's 16 Oct 2026 fix for overlapping
  roles — so against that instance a repeated role would fail during
  simulation with a host auth error instead.)
- **Failure surfaces:** a simulation failure (e.g. `InvalidState`) at
  propose time propagates the real contract error (500); Postgres
  `completeProposalId` / `refreshContractId` side effects after a
  successful submit are best-effort and logged, never masking a landed
  transaction (`src/server.ts:932`).
